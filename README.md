## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Yogesh**, and I am a PhD candidate at the Ohio State University, **specializing in genomics, computational biology, and cancer research**. My current work focuses on leveraging **genomics** to advance our understanding of **osteosarcoma** and other cancers.  
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on [**Osteo-CAR**](https://github.com/kidcancerlab/Osteo_atlas), a transcriptomic exploration and cell-type annotation resource for osteosarcoma across multiple species, aiming to standardize cell-type annotations and harmonize terminology for research.
- ðŸ”­ I am also working on developing **KITE-SCAN**, a computational tool that predicts **biologically informed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for cancer patients**, optimizing efficacy while minimizing toxicity.   
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **advanced computational biology techniques, RNA sequencing analysis, and bioinformatics tools to refine predictive models for precision medicine**.  

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out for collaborations or discussions on **genomics, computational biology, cancer biology, and developing computational tools!**
